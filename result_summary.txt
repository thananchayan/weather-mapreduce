Weather Data Analysis - Result Summary

Objective
---------
The goal of this MapReduce project was to analyze a real-world weather dataset and calculate:

1. Average Temperature per Country
2. Average Precipitation per Country

using the dataset "The Weather of 187 Countries in 2020" from Kaggle.

Dataset Details
---------------
- Format: CSV
- Records: 65,000+ rows
- Fields Used:
  - Country (index 2)
  - AvgTemperature (index 9)
  - Precipitation (index 6)

Experiments and Tasks
---------------------

Task 1: Average Temperature
- Extracted country and temperature fields.
- Used Java MapReduce to compute per-country temperature totals and counts.
- Calculated final average in Reducer.
- Output file: final_outputs/avg_temperature.csv

Task 2: Average Precipitation
- Extracted country and precipitation fields.
- Used Java MapReduce to compute total precipitation per country.
- Calculated average by dividing total by record count.
- Output file: final_outputs/avg_precipitation.csv

Observations
------------
- Countries like Brazil, India, and Indonesia showed higher average precipitation.
- Countries like Canada, Russia, and Iceland had lower average temperatures.
- Data inconsistencies (missing or invalid values) were filtered in the Mapper stage.
- Hadoop processed all records efficiently inside Docker environment using HDFS.

Suggestions for Improvement
---------------------------
- Add seasonal or monthly breakdowns for temperature and rainfall.
- Visualize data trends using tools like Tableau or Matplotlib.
- Explore other metrics such as humidity, wind speed, or extreme weather events.
- Clean and normalize categorical country names before aggregation.

Conclusion
----------
This project successfully demonstrates how Hadoop MapReduce can be used to perform large-scale weather data analysis, generating structured country-wise insights from raw climate datasets.
